# Problem Statement
* The objective of this project is to develop a highly accurate image classification model using the CIFAR-100 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 100 classes. The project aims to leverage advanced deep learning techniques to build and optimize a model that achieves superior classification accuracy and can classify any uploaded images into the defined classes.

* Objectives
1. Build an Accurate Classifier: Develop a model to classify CIFAR-100 images into one of the 100 classes.
2. Optimize Model Performance: Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
3. Visualize Model Insights: Create visualizations to interpret and understand model performance.
4. Deploy the Model: Build a user-friendly interface for real-time image classification.
5. Validate Hypotheses: Systematically test the hypotheses related to model performance and feature importance.
